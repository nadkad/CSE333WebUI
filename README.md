Hi Professor Scarlatos & Brandon!

I just wanted to say thank you for a great few semesters, 
and thank you for making it possible for me to specialize in Human-Computer Interaction!
If it weren't for you guys, there wouldn't be electives which allow CSE/ISE students to learn different, creative skills.
